//Relative Banks //
You are given an integer array score of size n, where score[i] is the score of the ith athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the 1st place athlete has the highest score, the 2nd place athlete has the 2nd highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

    The 1st place athlete's rank is "Gold Medal".
    The 2nd place athlete's rank is "Silver Medal".
    The 3rd place athlete's rank is "Bronze Medal".
    For the 4th place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").

Return an array answer of size n where answer[i] is the rank of the ith athlete.
approach:: first we need to make pair of the given score in order to not loosing the actual data .
--->  then we make the vector to store the the score with its actual positon 
--->  then we are going to reverse sort the score .
--->  then make a vector which can store string data type then retuen the pair vector's position data . 
class Solution {
public:
using intp=pair<int,int>;
    vector<string> findRelativeRanks(vector<int>& score) {
        int n=score.size();
        vector<intp> sIdx(n);
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
            sIdx.emplace_back(score[i], i);//make pair for not losing the correct position
        sort(sIdx.rbegin(), sIdx.rend());//reverse the score 
        vector<string> ans(n);
        ans[sIdx[0].second]="Gold Medal";
        if( n>1) ans[sIdx[1].second]="Silver Medal";
        if (n>2) ans[sIdx[2].second]="Bronze Medal";
        for(int i=3; i<n; i++)
            ans[sIdx[i].second]=to_string(i+1);
        return ans;
        
    }
};
